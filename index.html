    <h1>Info and a little blogish stuff ...</h1>

    <p>
        My name is Tommy Bengt Svensson (tombensve was nicer as username) and GitHub is a place where I'm having a bit of fun 
        being a code geek! You will find a whole lot of Groovy and a bit of Java here.

        I live in Stockholm, Sweden (nicer part of town, by water with the exception of water scooter zombies summertime).

        This is where I will do posts of things I consider releavant, very <i>sporadically</i>! Since I'm a user of the excellent 
        <a href="https://www.craft.do/">Craft app</a> I'll use that to make posts and publish links to them here.
