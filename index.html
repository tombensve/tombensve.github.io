    <p>
        I choose _tombensve_ as username to make it shorter and more likely unique. GitHub is a place where I'm having a bit of fun 
        being a code geek! You will find a whole lot of Groovy and a bit of Java here, and even some JS and React if you search
        deeply.

        I live in Stockholm, Sweden

        This is where I will do posts of things I consider releavant, very <i>sporadically</i>! Since I'm a user of the excellent 
        <a href="https://www.craft.do/">Craft app</a> I'll use that to make posts and publish links to them here. The content are
        mostly development / JVM related, but I might put upp other things also. This is for anyone that might be helped by
        something I've written, including myself!
