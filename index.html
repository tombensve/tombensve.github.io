    <h1>Tommys Bengt Svenssons public GitHub page</h1>

    <p>
        GitHub is a place where I'm having a bit of fun being a code geek! You will find a whole lot of Groovy and a bit 
        of Java here, and even some JS and React if you dig deep enough.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        I live in Stockholm, Sweden  
    </p>

    <p>
        I'm using this <i>github.io</i> page mostly for general information and some blogish stuff (very sporadic!).
        Since I'm a user of the excellent <a href="https://www.craft.do/">Craft app</a> I'll use that to make posts 
        and publish links to them here. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The content are mostly development / JVM related. I do this mostly as notes to myself when I have run
        into a problem and solved it, but I put it here to share with others also.  
    </p>
