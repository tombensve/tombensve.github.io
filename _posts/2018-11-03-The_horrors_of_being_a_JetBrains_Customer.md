I\'ve been using IntelliJ IDEA from JetBrains for many years. It has been a very good tool and still is. More recently I also purchased a subscription of YouTrack which I also find to be a very nice product, much better than Atlassians JIRA. 

I've been very satisfied with JetBrains customer service for a long time also, but something have clearly happened both on the developer side and customer side. A clear degradation.

I had a subscription of both IDEA and YouTrack. Now I don't have either, and it is entierly the fault of JetBrains.

JetBrains made some change in how to handle payments and I was forced to update to new "payment methods". It was not completely obvoius after having setup a new credit card payment method, how to connect this to the products. It took me several attempts through their support. I suspect that JetBrains have lost a lot of employees and hired new support staff that really does not speak Englsih very well. I did get a lot of idiot answers that had no relation to the question. It was a real fight to get them to understand the problem, and then to figure out how to solve it. But after a lot of mail conversations there were finally my credit card payment method assigned to both IDEA and YouTrack. That is at least what they told me. It also looked like it when logged in on account.jetbrains.com. 

Rather shortly after this I got a mail saying my YouTrack subscription was reaching renewal time and did not have a payment method! This made me quite upset after the very recent pain of getting this resolved. I got really angry at them, and told them that they needed to fix this. This resulted in someone from JetBrains calling me on the phone and ensuring me that everything was OK and the the renewal would be fine. 

Now, after the renewal time has passsed I'm standing without a renewal and are locked out of YouTrack. My account.jetbrains.com now contains a very old perpetual licence and a fresh, just expired ToolBox subscription that for some reason have no renewal option. YouTrack is completely gone from my account. 

I did everything I possibly could to avoid this from happening. This is 100% JetBrains fault!

Since I've been a longtime user of IDEA I had a long time customer price. Placing a new order for IDEA license will make it quite much more expensive. JetBrains seriously does not appreciate customers!
