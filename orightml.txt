Since I cannot delete this file while in GitHub, only crate and add to it
I will have to check out this repo, remove the file and then commit, which I
see no reason for not being able to do directly in GitHub UI by github doing
those actions for you and commet when you delete, but NO!

Also in Safari only the botom half of the first line will be shown when reading. 
If it is an Apple bug or GitHub bug I don't know.

It is also cutting the bottom of last line in preview. I'm considering doing all 
my development in a virtual Linux instead to go around shit like this!
